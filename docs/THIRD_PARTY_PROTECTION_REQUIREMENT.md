# Third-Party Protection Requirement - Legal Justification

## For Privacy Lawyer

**Third-Party Protection Requirement:** We require all third-party service providers who process our users' personal information to maintain security safeguards that provide a comparable level of protection to that which we implement directly. This requirement is mandated by PIPEDA Section 4.1.3 and Schedule 1, Principle 4.1.3, which explicitly requires organizations to use contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection when personal information is being processed by a third party, and is further reinforced by Quebec's Law 25 (Bill 64), which requires written agreements with service providers that include specific security obligations. In our case, this applies to Vercel Inc. (application hosting) and Neon Technologies Inc. or Vercel (database hosting), who act as data processors under our instructions. The requirement for "comparable protection" means processors must maintain industry-standard security measures including encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, incident response procedures, and compliance with applicable privacy laws, even if the specific technical implementation differs from our own. This standard ensures that users' personal information remains protected regardless of where it is stored or processed, thereby satisfying our obligations under PIPEDA and Law 25 to protect personal information throughout its lifecycle.
