---

## 🧪 **Testing Plan**

### **Test 1: Demo Login** (Most Important!)

**Action:**
1. Go to Vercel URL
2. Login with: `demo@canadianinsights.ca` / `northstar-demo`

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Login succeeds (200 OK)
- ✅ **Dashboard shows charts** (THIS IS THE KEY TEST!)
  - Monthly cash flow bars
  - Category pie chart
  - Numbers and data
- ✅ **Transactions tab shows ~200 items**
- ✅ **Budget tab shows category spending**
- ✅ **Savings tab shows goals**
- ✅ **Insights tab shows recommendations**

**What Changed:**
- Before: `{"summary":[]}` (empty)
- After: Full data with 12 months of aggregated transactions

---

### **Test 2: Dashboard Detailed Check**

**What to Verify:**
1. **Monthly Cash Flow Chart**
   - Shows last 3 months by default
   - Bars for income (green), expenses (red), other (blue)
   - Hover shows exact amounts
   - Can switch to 6 or 12 month view

2. **Category Breakdown**
   - Pie chart showing top categories
   - Housing, Groceries, Dining, Transportation, etc.
   - Real amounts ($1,650 rent, etc.)

3. **Summary Numbers**
   - Total income: ~$4,800/month
   - Total expenses: ~$2,800-3,200/month
   - Savings: ~$1,500-2,000/month

---

### **Test 3: Transactions Tab**

**Expected:**
- 200+ transactions listed
- Sorted by date (newest first)
- Shows: description, date, amount, category
- Tim Hortons, Loblaws, Rogers, etc.
- Amounts look realistic ($4-12 for coffee, $120-200 for groceries)

**Filters should work:**
- By category (Groceries, Dining, Transportation, etc.)
- By cashflow (income, expense, other)
- By date range

---

### **Test 4: Budget Tab**

**Expected:**
- Shows spending by category
- Top categories: Housing ($1,650), Groceries ($600-800), Dining ($400-600)
- Budget recommendations (5% reduction goals)
- Monthly vs quarterly view toggle

---

### **Test 5: Savings Tab**

**Expected:**
- Cumulative savings calculation
- Goals with progress bars (Emergency Fund, Vacation)
- "Last month" / "Year to date" / "Since starting" options

---

### **Test 6: Insights Tab**

**Expected:**
- "Top Spending: [Category]" with amount
- "Average Monthly Spending: $X"
- "Savings Rate: X%"

---

### **Test 7: New User Registration**

**Action:**
1. Sign out
2. Create account: `test@example.com` / `password123` / `Test User`

**Expected:**
- ✅ Account created
- ✅ Automatically logged in
- ✅ Dashboard is **EMPTY** (correct!)
- ✅ Shows "No transactions" or empty state
- ✅ Different from demo user (they have different data)

---

### **Test 8: Sign Out**

**Action:**
1. Click "Sign out"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Redirects to login
- ✅ Token cleared
- ✅ Can't access data endpoints

---

## 📊 **Success Criteria**

**All must be TRUE:**
- [ ] Demo login works (200 OK)
- [ ] **Dashboard shows charts and data** ✨ (KEY!)
- [ ] Transactions shows 200+ items
- [ ] Budget shows category breakdown
- [ ] Savings shows goals
- [ ] Insights shows recommendations
- [ ] New user registration works
- [ ] New user sees empty state (correct)
- [ ] Sign out works
- [ ] No 500 errors in Network tab
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in Console

**If all checked: 🎉 SUCCESS! App is fully functional!**

---

## 🔍 **What To Check in Network Tab**

After logging in as demo user:

```
✅ login              → 200 OK
✅ summary?window=3m  → 200 OK (or 304) - SHOULD HAVE DATA!
✅ transactions       → 200 OK (or 304) - ~200 items
✅ budget             → 200 OK (or 304) - Category data
✅ savings            → 200 OK (or 304) - Goals data
✅ insights           → 200 OK (or 304) - Insights array
```

**Click on `/api/summary` response:**
```json
{
  "months": ["Aug 24", "Sep 24", "Oct 24"],
  "income": [4800, 5600, 4800],
  "expense": [3200, 2900, 3100],
  "other": [-500, -500, -500],
  "categories": [
    {"name": "Housing", "value": 1650},
    {"name": "Groceries", "value": 680},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Should NOT be:** `{"summary":[]}`

---

## 🐛 **If Dashboard Is Still Empty**

### **Possible Issues:**

**Issue 1: Database not initialized**
- **Check:** Vercel function logs
- **Look for:** `[DB] Initializing database...`
- **Solution:** Wait 2 seconds, refresh page

**Issue 2: Demo user has no transactions**
- **Check:** Vercel logs for: `[DB] Seeded X sample transactions`
- **Solution:** May need to manually delete and recreate demo user

**Issue 3: Frontend not rendering data**
- **Check:** Browser Console for JS errors
- **Check:** Network response has data but charts don't show
- **Solution:** Might be frontend rendering issue (separate from backend)

---

## 🚨 **Emergency Fixes**

### **If demo login still fails (401):**
```sql
-- Connect to database via Neon dashboard
DELETE FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%canadian%';
-- App will recreate on next init
```

### **If data is empty:**
```sql
-- Check if transactions exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions WHERE user_id = 1;

-- If 0, delete user to force re-seed
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
-- App will recreate with data on next init
```
