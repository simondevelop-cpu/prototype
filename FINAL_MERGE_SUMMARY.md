## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### **1. React Hooks Violation**
- **Issue**: Hooks called inside render functions
- **Impact**: Client-side exceptions, app crashes
- **Fixed**: Moved all state to component level

### **2. Users Not Showing in Admin**
- **Issue**: SQL join on non-existent `users.user_id` column
- **Impact**: Empty accounts table
- **Fixed**: Changed to `users.id = transactions.user_id`

### **3. Category Dropdown Only Showing 3 Options**
- **Issue**: Built from existing transactions only
- **Impact**: Users couldn't select all categories
- **Fixed**: Include all predefined categories from CATEGORIES object

### **4. Date Field Not Auto-Populating**
- **Issue**: Timestamp format incompatible with `<input type="date">`
- **Impact**: Users had to manually re-enter dates
- **Fixed**: Format date to YYYY-MM-DD

### **5. Recategorization Not Saving**
**Multiple issues discovered and fixed:**
- ❌ Missing `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- ❌ JWT secret mismatch (`dev-secret-key` vs `canadian-insights-demo-secret-key-change-in-production`)
- ❌ Production DB schema incompatibility (old column names)
- ✅ All fixed with schema-adaptive code

### **6. Recategorization Log Showing Blank Columns**
- **Issue**: Querying `corrected_category` but DB has `category`
- **Impact**: Category and Label columns empty
- **Fixed**: Added fallback with SQL aliases
